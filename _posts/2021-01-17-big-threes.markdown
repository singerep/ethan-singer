The history of NBA basketball is filled with iconic duos: Jordan and Pippen, Shaq and Kobe, Magic and Kareem, you get the idea. But with the addition of James Harden, the Brooklyn Nets have placed themselves on a much more exclusive list: teams with superstar *trios*. So how do Harden, Durant, and Irving stack up against histroy's greatest big threes?

To answer this question, we can use 538's RAPTOR metric, a statistic that measures "the number of points a player contributes to his teamâ€™s offense and defense per 100 possessions, relative to a league-average player." By combining the RAPTOR scores of each team's best three players, we can begin to compare the NBA's best-ever trios.

Offensively, Brooklyn's big three is among the best ever. Since 1977, the first year for which RAPTOR metrics are availible, the trio rank just second in combined offensive value, behind only Houston's 2018 trio of Harden, Chris Paul, and Eric Gordon.

In fact, the 2020-21 Nets are now one of just 13 teams since 1997 to have three players that rank 16th or better in offensive RAPTOR, a feat last accomplished in 2012 by the Oklahoma City Thunder (Harden, Durant, and Westbrook).

The most obvious challenge for the new Brooklyn trio will be making sure the ball can get into everyone's hands. Using a statistic called usage, a value that estimates "the percentage of team plays used by a player while they were on the floor", we can compare the trio's ball usage to other famous big threes. Not suprisingly, very few teams have had three players that all use the ball as much as Harden, Durant, and Irving. Since 1977, the first year for which usage rates are availible, the trio rank just 18th in combined usage. 

They would rank substantially higher, however, if Harden had not sharply declined his usage since his arrival in Brooklyn: his usage rate on the Nets is 5.8 points lower than his career average. Meawhile, his assist rate, which represents the percentage of his team's field goals that he assisted, is 9.2 points above his career average. If Harden had instead maintained his career average usage rate, Brooklyn would rank first all time in combined usage between their new big three.

Historically, teams with high combined usage between their most used players had mixed results.

So will the trio's extraordinarily high combined usage will ultimately help or hinder their progress? We'll have to wait and see.
