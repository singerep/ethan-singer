Ethan Singer is pursuing a B.A. in Statistics and Computer Science and a minor in Public Policy Analysis at Boston University (class of '24). He's interested in data analysis, and he has a particular passion for researching electoral politics, policy, and sports. [Here](/resume.pdf) is his resume. He hopes to one day be famous enough to meet Steve Kornacki.

In his free time, Ethan partakes in a wide variety of activities. He enjoys working on independent research projects, some of which he has written about here. He enjoys pestering his brother with requests to go play tennis, his father with amusing anecdotes from the latest book he is reading, and his mother with up-to-the-minute updates from their favorite legal analysts on Twitter. He is a big sports fan; he loves all the Washington sports teams, but he holds the Nationals, Capitals, and Football Team particularly dear.

He's a R&B, pop, and (unabashed) country fan. His favorite artists are J. Cole, Luke Combs, Zach Bryan, Kanye, and Mac Miller. His favorite shows include Arrested Development, Queen's Gambit, Stranger Things, and Gilmore Girls. He makes a mean grilled cheese and has an uncanny ability to sense how much time is left on the microwave timer.
